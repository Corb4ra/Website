      <h1>About This Project</h1><br><br>
      <p>This project idea lends itself really well to being solved by computational methods. Being able to produce fast, accurate airflow simulations virtually is a game changer for product development. It also reduces the two most limiting factors in design and testing: time and cost.<br><br> 
Prototyping is an age-old product development method, and it’s not really surprising – if you want to test something, make it and then you can run all the tests you’d like on it. The problem is that, as with software development, nothing ever works perfectly the first time. Often there are many different adjustments to be made, which has a huge impact on the time scale (as the prototypes must be changed and manufactured) and the cost (manufacturing anything is expensive). 
My project helps to combat these two problems. The more CFD you can do, the better idea you can have about the performance of your product, and you can begin to iron out some of the issues digitally. This means that less prototypes must be made, and thus reducing the overall cost of the development. It is unrealistic to expect that prototyping will be completely scrapped, considering how invaluable it is, but generally speaking, the more CFD the better. Whilst our technology has increased to a level of comparability, you simply cannot assume that a product will perform exactly the same digitally as in real life. So inevitably, there will always be some prototyping, but the aim of my project is to produce some software that can reduce the need for this.<br><br> 
In addition to the cost of building a prototype, you also must consider the cost of running the tests. It costs money to hire/run testing facilities, especially with physical wind tunnels being as expensive as they are (with some costing tens of thousands of pounds per day). The less physical wind tunnel tests that are needed, the less energy is needed to be consumed to power them. Depending on the wind tunnel, they can consume between 20 and 200 million Watts of electricity per hour, which is dreadful for the environment. Sustainability is one of the most important concepts in modern engineering, so having a project that can help solve an environmental problem is invaluable in the real world.
Moreover, as my software is designed specifically to work with STL files (one of the most common file formats for 3D printing), it can greatly speed up the development process. The object can be created as an STL file, that can be imported straight into my software, tested, and then sent to be 3D printed, all in the space of a few hours. This is perfect for quick projects that have short deadlines as the time for the whole development and testing process is cut down significantly.<br><br> 
As I mentioned before, physical wind tunnel testing will most likely never be completely eradicated. This means that most companies will have to fork out huge amounts of money to hire the right facilities, or spend even more to build their own. However, for companies working on smaller-scale projects with a limited budget, this is simply not possible. Providing a free way to perform this essential testing is something that can only be achieved with computers. 
What my project focusses on is bridging the gap between prototyping and CFD testing at a level accessible to all. The idea is to take an STL file that is being used for 3D printing, for example, and be able to aerodynamically test it before having to manufacture the object. This is achieved by the all-important STL processor, which will convert this STL file into a format that can have airflow simulations run on. This will be the bulk of my project, and where a lot of the time and effort will go into, because this isn’t done very much, and there isn’t much documentation out there on how to do it. But nevertheless, I’m looking forward to the challenge.<br><br>
