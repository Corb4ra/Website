      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>Getting started on this easy - simply follow the step-by-step guide below:<br><br>
          1. Click the 'Upload a File' button<br>
          2. Use the file explorer popup window to navigate to the storage location of the STL file you would like to upload<br>
          3. The full path of the file will appear on the screen, along with a large 'run' button - click this<br>
          4. It should take a few seconds to load, but the results should appear automatically on the screen in a new window for you to observe<br>
      </p>

      <h2>Uploading a File</h2>
      <p>Some extra information on uploading a file, just in case something has gone wrong.<br><br>
         The file being selected MUST be an STL file. If it isn't, then it causes big problems and the software will not work. If your file is not an STL file, then you can use online<br> conversion tools to do so, enabling you to use my software<br><br>
         The file explorer window is exactly the same as it is on your device, so wherever your file is stored on your device is where you will find it in this window<br><br>
         Make sure to press 'open' in the file explorer window once you have selected the file. If you don't then no file will be selected and the program will not run. Once you have pressed 'open',<br> the file explorer window will close automatically, showing you that you've done it correctly. Double check the file path to ensure you have selected the correct file before running the software. This avoids wasting your time waiting for the wrong model to be tested
